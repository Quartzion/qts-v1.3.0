**Quartzion’s Technical Analysis** is the first step to identifying and solving your most pressing technical challenges. This phase allows our engineering team to uncover detailed insights about your systems, workflows, and strategic opportunities for improvement.

---

### What to Expect

- A kickoff conversation with your team to gather in-depth situational data.
- Independent engineering analysis by Quartzion’s technical team.
- A clear, actionable report outlining your current technical state and options for improvement or implementation.

---

### Use Cases

- Evaluating systems for upgrade or modernization
- Diagnosing underperformance or failure
- Planning new solution deployments
- Understanding legacy system limitations

---

### Flexible Engagement

The technical analysis comes with **no commitment** to further development contracts. Use the resulting report with your internal team or any engineering provider.

> _Start with clarity. Get a clear, engineering-grade understanding of your technical landscape — before making commitments._

When systems underperform, every moment counts. Quartzion’s **Troubleshooting** service is a rapid-response solution designed to diagnose and resolve technology issues in environments where tools are already in place—but not functioning as intended.

Whether your organization is experiencing persistent bugs, integration failures, or inefficiencies tied to legacy systems or third-party tools, our engineering team steps in with precision. This service is ideal for teams who need targeted technical support to regain control, optimize operations, and reduce downtime—without committing to a full rebuild or long-term overhaul.

#### **Who is it for?**

- Organizations managing in-house or third-party systems that are falling short  
- Teams with a dedicated IT professional or technical lead who can provide system-level access and architecture details  
- Stakeholders who need actionable insight fast, but aren’t sure where the bottleneck lies  

#### **How it works**

Once engaged, Quartzion engineers conduct a focused discovery session to gather system credentials, integration architecture, and environment details. We then work side-by-side with your internal team to replicate the issue, identify root causes, and outline a clear resolution path—whether immediate fixes or a roadmap for optimization.

For clients without a dedicated technical lead, we recommend beginning with our **Technical Analysis** service. This ensures our team can provide a complete system audit and deliver the necessary context to troubleshoot effectively.

#### **Why it matters**

- Rapid diagnosis minimizes operational risk  
- Specialized engineering support without long-term vendor lock-in  
- Ideal for optimizing investments in existing technology tools  

If your team is ready to move quickly on a known issue—or needs a second set of expert eyes—**Troubleshooting with Quartzion** delivers fast, informed action.

**Let’s get your systems back on track.**  
Start with a discovery call and let our engineers take it from there.

**Unlock full control of your technology environment with Quartzion’s most powerful service: Solution Development.** This end-to-end offering is built to help organizations reduce recurring costs, gain ownership over their systems, and implement scalable solutions—custom-engineered to fit your team’s unique operational needs.

Whether you're looking to replace expensive third-party tools or build proprietary systems from scratch, Quartzion delivers lean, maintainable technology tailored to your budget, workflow, and long-term vision.

#### **What’s Included**

Solution Development can include (but is not limited to):

- Custom website development  
- API development and systems integration  
- Internal process automation tools  
- Data management and dashboards  
- Lightweight user interfaces  
- Full-stack applications built for scalability  

Our engineers assess your requirements and design a modern solution using technologies that are cost-effective, easy to manage, and built for the long haul.

#### **Built for Organizations That:**

- Have outgrown expensive or underutilized software  
- Want full control and ownership over their technology and data  
- Are ready to reduce operational costs through tailored engineering  
- Need a clean, maintainable solution developed around specific business needs  

#### **Already Have Requirements Prepared?**

If your team already has a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**, we can skip right to solution scoping. Quartzion will draft a **Technical Specifications Document (TSD)** for your approval—allowing your team to move directly into the contracting and development phase.

#### **No BRD? No Problem.**

Teams without a BRD can either:
- Begin with our **Technical Analysis** service to build one collaboratively  
- Or, if Quartzion is your chosen vendor, allow us to generate both BRD and TSD for your review  

Either way, we’ll ensure your goals and constraints are translated into a technical roadmap that supports budget-conscious, scalable outcomes.

#### **Cost Transparency at Every Step**

We prioritize **low-cost or free-tier technologies** whenever possible and guide you through all cost trade-offs, from:
- Free vs. paid hosting  
- Light-use vs. high-scale data strategies  
- Open-source vs. commercial tooling  

You’ll receive a complete breakdown during the specification and contract phase—so there are no surprises down the road.

#### **Project Lifecycle**

Each Solution Development engagement includes:

- Discovery & Requirements Phase  
- Technical Documentation & Contracting  
- Iterative Engineering with Feedback Cycles  
- Stakeholder Review & Approval Phases  
- Final Handoff or Ongoing Support (optional)  

**No in-house tech team?** You can optionally extend into our **Solution Management** service, which provides a dedicated Quartzion engineer under contract to maintain and support your system post-launch.
